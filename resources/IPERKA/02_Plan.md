# Planning

## How I planned this assignment

### High Level Steps
1. Brainstorm to identify milestones & tasks
2. Create a resource plan
3. Create a list of milestones
4. Create a task list

### Brainstorm
* I began by brainstorming the phases of the project to break down the tasks. I wanted to ensure the website would include all the necessary features, including user registration, login functionality, and personalized game recommendations.
* During my planning, I thought of the core features first and then proceeded to structure the project step by step.

### Resource Plan
Since my time for the project was quite limited, I created a resource plan from the start to the end date, to organize my time efficiently.
* I defined a start date (wich was the 18.2.2025) and an end date (wich was the 29.4.2025) for the assignment to create a realistic timeframe.
* I divided my day into Two periods: afternoon, and evening, and marked out the periods when I could work on the assignment.
* I calculated the number of **available hours** to make sure I could meet the deadlines.

### Using GitHub as a Task List
* To keep track of my tasks and milestones, I decided to use GitHub
* I created a GitHub project called **Game_Chooser** and used it as a centralized place to track my tasks and progress.
---

### Milestones
* I laid out seven simple milestones for the project to break down the work into manageable stages.
  
![Milestones][plan1]

---

### How I Created the Task List
* After brainstorming, I identified as many tasks as possible that needed to be completed to achieve the project goals.
* I then wrote the Milestones down so i can remember them.
* I also defined the start and due dates for each task using the resource plan.
* To make sure I stayed within the available time (30-40 hours), I calculated the total number of hours required and adjusted tasks accordingly.

---

### Managing the Task List
* I regularly updated the task list by filtering tasks, checking due dates, and adjusting the Actual effort field as work progressed.
* Occasionally, I started tasks before the scheduled time, so I adjusted the start and due dates accordingly.
* New tasks were also added to the list as I identified them during the development process.
