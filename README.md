# My Own Website with Node.js

## Overview

Welcome to my **game suggestion website**, created using **Node.js**, **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**! The website is designed to allow users to discover new games based on their personal preferences. The core functionality includes:

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can create an account, log in, and manage their credentials securely.
- **Secure Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed using **SHA-256**, **salted** and **peppered** for additional security.
- **Game Recommendation System**: Based on user-selected preferences, the website suggests games that match their criteria, such as genre, difficulty, and length.
- **Node.js Server**: The app runs on a simple Node.js server, making it easy to extend and manage.

This application is a perfect example of how **Node.js** and **JavaScript** can be used to create a functional, interactive web application.

### Features:
- **User Registration and Login**: With secure password hashing (salt and pepper).
- **Game Recommendations**: Personalized suggestions based on selected preferences.
- **Secure User Authentication**: Passwords are hashed and securely stored, preventing sensitive data leakage.
- **LocalStorage Integration**: User data is managed using **LocalStorage**, simplifying data storage on the client side.
