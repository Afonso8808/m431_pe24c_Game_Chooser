# IPERKA Documentation for My Own Website with Node.js

## How I gathered the information needed for this assignment

### How did I get the idea
* The idea was to create a game recommendation website where users can get personalized game suggestions based on their preferences. I wanted to include features like user registration, login functionality, and a secure way to store passwords. I thought about implementing hashing, salting, and peppering to ensure the passwords are stored securely.
* After exploring different options, I realized that **Node.js** would be the best framework for the backend, as it allows creating a simple yet effective server. **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** would be used for the frontend.

### What type of information did I need
* **Dates**:
  * The final deadline for the project was set by my teacher and it was the 29 of April for the project and the 6.may for the presentation. This meant that I had to ensure everything was completed on time, including implementation, documentation, and testing.
* **Deliverables**:
  * The product I needed to deliver was a working **website** that allows users to register, log in, and get personalized game recommendations.
  * I also needed to submit the **documentation** detailing the entire process, including design, coding, and testing.
* **Knowledge**:
  * I had to learn **JavaScript**, as I had never used it before, especially for tasks like password hashing, local storage handling, and managing game recommendations dynamically.
  * Additionally, I needed to refresh my knowledge of **Node.js** for setting up the server and handling HTTP requests.
* **Tools needed**:
  * I needed to choose the right tools for **coding** (Visual Studio Code, Node.js, etc.), and **version control** (GitHub).

## Gathering Information

### Requirements for the Product
* There were two sources for requirements: my teacher (the customer) and my own vision for how I wanted the website to function.
* From my side, I wanted the website to be simple, beginner-friendly, and focused on security. The main features I envisioned were:
  * **User registration** and **login**
  * **Game recommendation** based on selected preferences like genre, difficulty, and game length
  * Secure storage of passwords with **salt** and **pepper**
* After gathering these requirements, I started planning and documenting them to ensure the project met the expectations.

### Requirements for the Documentation
* The documentation requirements were laid out clearly, and I had to ensure I covered everything, including:
  * **Technical explanation** of how the website works
  * **Code snippets** explaining the logic behind important features like user registration and game recommendations
  * **Screenshots** and visual aids showing the website in action

## What type of information did I gather

* **Dates**:
  * The deadline for submission was set, and I ensured all my work was completed well before the due date, allowing enough time for testing and adjustments.
* **Deliverables**:
  * The main deliverable was the **game recommendation website**. The code should be fully functional, and the documentation should explain every part of the project.
* **Tutorial Needed**:
  * I had to learn about **password hashing**, **salt**, and **pepper** techniques. I used online resources and tutorials to understand how to implement these concepts securely in JavaScript.
* **Tools Needed**:
  * I identified the tools I would need for coding, documentation, version control, and testing.

## Goals

### Key Goals for the Project:

1. **Create a game recommendation website**:
   - **Achievable**: A working website with a backend server running on Node.js, with a clear frontend to interact with the user.
   - **Measured by**: Successfully deploying the website with working features such as user login, game recommendations, and security measures.
   - **Realistic**: With a clear focus on creating a small-scale project, this goal was achievable within the project timeframe.
   - **Timely**: The website was expected to be fully operational by the deadline.

2. **Learn password hashing and salting techniques**:
   - **Achievable**: By implementing hashing, salting, and peppering in the user registration and login process.
   - **Measured by**: The successful implementation of password encryption, ensuring users' credentials were stored securely.
   - **Timely**: I ensured that hashing was implemented in the first phase of the project, allowing enough time for testing and troubleshooting.

## Tools Needed

### Tools for Coding:
* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: I used **VS Code** as my code editor. It's a lightweight, user-friendly IDE that supports JavaScript and Node.js development. It also has useful extensions for linting and debugging.
* **Node.js**: This was the backend server I used to handle HTTP requests. With Node.js, I could easily serve static files and handle user registration and login functionality.
* **Git and GitHub**: For version control, I used **Git** and hosted my project on **GitHub**. This allowed me to track changes, collaborate with others, and share my progress.

### Tools for User Interface:
* **HTML/CSS**: For the frontend, I used **HTML** for structuring the web pages and **CSS** for styling. The design was kept simple to ensure ease of use.
* **JavaScript**: I used **JavaScript** to handle dynamic functionality such as form submissions, game recommendations, and the password hashing process.
* **LocalStorage**: I used **localStorage** for temporarily storing user data (username, hashed password) during testing and debugging.

### Tools for Documentation:
* **Markdown**: For writing the documentation, I used **Markdown**. This made it easy to format the text and include code snippets.
* **Snipping Tool**: For capturing **screenshots** of the website, I used the **Snipping Tool** on Windows.
* **Microsoft Paint**: For creating Sketches, I used **ms Paint**, which allowed me to visually represent the structure of the website and its flow.
